    <h3> Runabc </h3>
<p> The latest version of the source code is still found on
<a href="https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html">ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html</a>.
<p>
<b>Runabc</b> is a user interface to the abcmidi, abcm2ps, and
abc2svg packages described elsewhere. Like EasyABC it
allows you to create, edit, render and play ABC music
notation files. The user interface is not as nice as
EasyABC, but this program has a lot more functionality
and is still being updated fairly frequently. The program is written in
tcl/tk scripting language which unfortunately is tending
to be forgotten language. In contrast, EasyABC is written in
Python, a very popular language like Java, JavaScript,
and C++. Owing to the difficulty of overcoming various
problems with Python and its libraries, development of
EasyABC has been slow.

<p>
There is already extensive documentation on how to use
runabc.tcl on <a href=https://runabc.sourceforge.io>https://runabc.sourceforge.io</a>,
so this note merely describes the content of this repository.

<p>
<b>runabc.tcl</b> is the biggest file and contains the source
code. Assuming tcl/tk is already installed on your system,
you run runabc.tcl from a command window (or terminal) by
entering:

<p>
wish runabc.tcl

<p>
<b>runabc.ico</b> is the icon

<p>
<b>runabc.nsi</b> and <b>setup_runabc.iss</b> are scripts for creating
an installer on Windows using either Nullsoft Scriptable Install
or Inno Setup Script Wizard respectively. Presently I only
use the latter. On Windows, I create a runabc.exe executable
which includes the tcl/tk interpreter using starkits.

<p>
<b>gpl.txt</b> contains the Gnu general public license.

<p>
<b>runabc.txt</b> describes the design of the source code.

<p>
The abc file, <b>nmodes.abc</b> is actually required by runabc.tcl, in
the case that you are using histogram matching to determine
the mode (major, dorian, minor, ...) of the music. The file should
be placed where runabc can find it -- usually in runabc_home.
<p>

The remaining stuff are in three separate folders described here.
<p>

<b>abc_examples</b> contains some files if you are interested in
percussion instruments.
<p>

<b>extensions</b> contains some tcl/tk code which can be loaded
into runabc using the options menu item load runabc extension.
<p>

and finally, <b>layout_files</b> contains a bunch of fmt files
that abcm2ps or abc2svg can use.
